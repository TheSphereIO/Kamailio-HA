#Default SSH user is defined in ansible.cfg file as root. You can override this for each host using ansible_ssh_user behavioral parameter.
#Also default ssh port is assumed to be 22 in ansible.cfg. Again you can override this using: ansible_ssh_port parameter.

#Each line must have the following format:
#alias ansible_ssh_host=<addr> ansible_ssh_pass=<pass>
